It turns out this prints a lot better with the outside down, on the bed, despite the fillets.
Enabling support interface with a roof and a floor, and a thickness of 1.5mm seems good, on the outside, but not on the joystick, so maybe eliminate some of the support there.
For some people, the buttons fit perfectly the first time, but I had to lower the size to 95% to get them to move easily. I still had a couple that bound up for some reason. 
Make sure to leave enough space under the support material for the lanyard hooks, or it can be really difficult to remove.
