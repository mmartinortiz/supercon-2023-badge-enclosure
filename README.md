This is an enclosure for the Hackaday Supercon 2023 Vectorscope badge

These files are available for anybody to 3d print, modify, remix, etc. in advance of the 2023 Hackaday Superconference, so that they might have an elegant enclosure for their badge.

The intention is that there will be multiple versions of this enclosure.

Basic is the most basic version. It is designed as a jumping off point for more elaborate designs with a simple, clean, rounded shape that shouldn't hurt you if you are wearing it.

More versions will be described here as they appear.
